# Plink

Plink is a small Android clicker/clicker-style game built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose (
Material3).

## About

A simple incremental/clicker game that lets players collect coins, upgrade abilities, and progress
through a casual economy. The app uses Jetpack Compose for UI, DataStore for settings persistence,
and a modern Material 3 theme.
